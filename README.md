Just experimenting with Python static site generation for now.

## Phase One

To begin with, I am getting the [Django Distill](https://github.com/meeb/django-distill) [example site](https://github.com/meeb/django-distill-example/) running.

- Go to [repo settings GUI](/../../settings/pages) and manually select a publish branch
- Check to see if [dependabot is working](/../../network/updates)
